<h4>My name is Sunny Patel and I live in Princeton, New Jersey for all 18 years of my life. I was born at John F. Kennedy Hospital in Edison, New Jersey.
	One of my hobbies that I really enjoy is photography, even though I am still an amateur.
        I bought a new camera last year and I am starting to use it, but it takes time to learn.
        I also enjoy watching sports especially football. I am a huge Eagles fan and I even play fantasy football with friends and family members.
        Ever since I was 10 years old, I had a passion for building computers from scratch. I would buy all the parts and then assemble it according to directions.
        As this passion grew, I decided to major in Computer Engineering and I hope that I can participate in the joint BS/MS program where I can get a BS and MS degree in Computer Engineering in 5 years instead of 6 at Georgia Tech.
        I enjoy the hardware aspect of computers being able to design and build new hardware components for computers in something I look forward to.
